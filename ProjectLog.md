- Created questions & made it work.
- Have to do some fixing for the {key} that said have to be unique.
- Did a basic setTimeOut (2 seconds to next questions).
- Created 2nd button to go to the next question but needs to be fixed so it will only available after we click the OK button (which means user have to submit questions 1st).
- Started on show correct/false answer (in progress) & next time we should create a better solution for it so it's closer to our initial plan.
