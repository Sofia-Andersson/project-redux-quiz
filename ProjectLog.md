Tue 25/10/2022 (Joel, Kartika, Linnea, Maria)

- Created questions & made it work.
- Have to do some fixing for the {key} that said have to be unique.
- Did a basic setTimeOut (2 seconds to next questions).
- Created 2nd button to go to the next question but needs to be fixed so it will only available after we click the OK button (which means user have to submit questions 1st).
- Started on show correct/false answer (in progress) & next time we should create a better solution for it so it's closer to our initial plan.

- Don't forget to pull! ðŸŒ·ðŸŒ¼ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒº

Thurs 20.00 27/10/2022 (Kartika, Sofia, Maria & Joel)

- Worked more on the CSS

Thurs 23.00 27/10/2022 (Kartika & Maria)

- MEDIA QUERYYYYY
- Changed folder names so it looked more similar to each other
- Icon hippo ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¦›
- Please check if there is anything else we need to do (especially try the media querry once more)
- Meta Tags
- The gifs worked well, BUT the 2nd gif (for 3 correct answer) appears to be smaller size than the others. Reason is because it is a landscape size while others are portrait. So, if you feel like that is a big problem, feel free to find a portrait gif that fits more for this page. Otherwise....nu kÃ¶r vi dÃ¥
